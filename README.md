# Random Forest Using QRNG (Quantum Random Number Generator)

This repository implements a Random Forest algorithm using Quantum Random Number Generation (QRNG) for enhanced randomness in the forest generation process. The project combines classical machine learning with quantum computing concepts to potentially improve the random forest's diversity and performance.

## 📋 Overview

This project explores the integration of quantum random number generation into the Random Forest algorithm. Instead of using classical pseudo-random numbers, we utilize quantum-generated random numbers for various aspects of the random forest construction, including:
- Bootstrap sampling of training data
- Feature selection at each node
- Split point selection

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and documentation
- Quantum Computing Libraries
- Machine Learning Libraries

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository contains both Python scripts (`.py`) and Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`) demonstrating the implementation and experiments.
